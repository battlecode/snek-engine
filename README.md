# Battlecode 2025 Python

ðŸš©

## Note, Competitors
This is the development repo! You most likely won't need anything in here; do not clone this.
Instead, follow the instructions [here](https://play.battlecode.org/bc25python/quick_start) to get started.

This repository contains all the code for the Battlecode Python engine.

## Installation and Usage

### Installation

To install the engine as a local package, run

```
$ pip install --user -e .
```

(Note for mac people: you may need to replace `pip` with `pip3`.)

The `-e` flag allows you to change the source code and have the changes be automatically reflected without needing to reinstall.

Test it out by trying:

```
$ python3 run.py --p1 examplefuncsplayer --p2 examplefuncsplayer --map DefaultSmall
```

If you would like to uninstall, simply run

```
$ pip uninstall battlecode25
```
